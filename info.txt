This is a game that I worked on last year using pygame in python to create. It includes many games on it including flappy bird, brick breaker, crossy road, and a few games I have created myself. These include a battle game where you fight against enemy blocks by shooting them, and game where there is one enemy that is trying to kill you while you eat as many apples as you can. There is also one more game on this program made with java. It is a game where two players are put into a maze and have to fight each other. Each game has its own settings in the settings menu. The game has a story mode where you are taking through a story where you go on a mission to get your cookie back from the cookie stealing boss which includes a maze game I created in java. The program also has many soundtrack and wallpapers that you can change in the settings.
